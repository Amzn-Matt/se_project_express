# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This project uses Express.js to create routes and listen to http requests from the app. MondoDB is utilized to enable Javasript to communicate with documents. In this project the sever can successfully receive requests to create new users and get user data from all active users or specific users by User ID. As well as requests to create, retrieve, like, dislike and delete clothing items.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12

**Project Features**

- JavaScrpit
- Express.js
- MongoDB

**Next Steps**
To further improve this project I will enable the server to receive authentification data as well as assign user ID's dynamically to created clothing items to ensure each user can have their own unique clothing items.
